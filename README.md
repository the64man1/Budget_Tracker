## Description
    
This application allows users to track their budget by adding expenses and revenue, while either online or offline. Users can add revenues and expenses, view the history of their transactions, and view a chart of their information. Most importantly, as this application was developed as a progressive web application, users will still be abek.

In completing this project, in which I was tasked with developing the application into a progressive web app to allow for offline functionality, I learned how to make use of IndexDb for storing of data in the browser while offline, how to use Webpack to develop bundled Javascript code to maximize performance and build a manifest.json file for saving things, and how to use a service worker to store data in the broswer cache.
